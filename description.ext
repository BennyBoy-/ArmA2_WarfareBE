		Warfare is a gamemode which focus on the PvPvAI (Player versus Player versus AI), 
		each team has a commander which have to build a base and perform upgrades. 
		
		The others players have to conquer towns in order to gain more supply, this supply is used 
		to build a base and perform upgrades, a town generate a variable income each x min (Supply
		and Funds), the funds are used to purchase different assets (Infantry, Vehicles, Support...)
		
		Each team has a MHQ, This last one is used to build the base, once that the MHQ is lost,
		The commander won't be able to build a base until that the MHQ get fixed with a repair
		truck.
		
		The towns are defended by resistance, once that all resistance is neutralized, the town
		will belong to the team who took it, depending on the Supply Value of the town, a defense
		team will spawn in that town to prevent enemy from taking it.
		
		The game will end as soon as all towns are captured by a side or once that all of a side's base
		is destroyed.
